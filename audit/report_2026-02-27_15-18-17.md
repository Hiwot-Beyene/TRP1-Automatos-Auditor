## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the audit of the document. Overall score: 3.0/5 across 2 criteria. Notable dissents or synthesis rules applied are noted in the criterion breakdown.

## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 3/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 3, Defense 4, TechLead 3.
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Terms appear in detailed architectural explanations. The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas. Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connec... Avoid: Terms appear only in the executive summary or introduction. No connection to actual implementation. 'We used D...

- **Defense** (score 4): The report provides a detailed explanation of the architecture, including the implementation of Fan-In and Fan-Out in the context of graph edges and error handling, demonstrating a good understanding of the concepts.
  - *Cited evidence:* StateGraph Flow: Detective Fan-Out and Fan-In, Conditional edges is required for error handling
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): Parse/LLM error after retries: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` in organization `org_...
- **TechLead** (score 3): Parse/LLM error after retries: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` in organization `org_...

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 3/5
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradict...

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Theoretical Depth (Documentation)** (score 3/5)
   - Aim for: Terms appear in detailed architectural explanations. The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas. Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connec... Avoid: Terms appear only in the executive summary or introduction. No connection to actual implementation. 'We used Dialectical Synthesis' with no explanation of ho...

2. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 3/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
