## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 2/5
- **Dissent:** Score variance > 2; re-evaluation applied. Prosecutor: 1; Defense: 1; TechLead: 5. The report fails to provide a substantive explanation of key architectural concepts, relying on buzz | The report lacks a clear explanation of how the architecture implements Theoretical Depth concepts.
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Terms appear in detailed architectural explanations. The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas. Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connec... Avoid: Terms appear only in the executive summary or introduction. No connection to actual implementation. 'We used D...

- **Defense** (score 1): The report lacks a clear explanation of how the architecture implements Theoretical Depth concepts.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=False, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): The report fails to provide a substantive explanation of key architectural concepts, relying on buzzwords without implementation details.
  - *Cited evidence:* Keyword Dropping of 'Dialectical Synthesis', Keyword Dropping of 'Fan-In / Fan-Out', Keyword Dropping of 'Metacognition', Keyword Dropping of 'State Synchronization'
- **TechLead** (score 5): The report demonstrates a thorough understanding of theoretical concepts and their practical implementation in the architecture. The terms 'Dialectical Synthesis', 'Fan-In / Fan-Out', 'Metacognition', and 'State Synchronization' are not just mentioned in the executive summary ...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=False, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 1/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 1, Defense 1, TechLead 2.
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradict...

- **Defense** (score 1): The provided architectural diagram is unclear and does not accurately represent the LangGraph State Machine. The vision call failed to extract meaningful information from the images, and the rationale suggests that the model was not found. Therefore, I cannot provide a clear a...
  - *Cited evidence:* Vision call failed: Error calling model 'gemini-1.5-flash' (NOT_FOUND): 404 NOT_, models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): The evidence suggests a failure to extract and analyze the diagrams, which is crucial for understanding the architecture. The vision call failed, indicating a problem with the model or API, but this does not excuse the lack of manual analysis or alternative methods.
  - *Cited evidence:* vision call failed, 404 NOT_FOUND
- **TechLead** (score 2): The diagrams in the report are unclear and do not accurately represent the LangGraph State Machine architecture. The parallel split is not explicitly visualized, and the flow is not distinct between parallel branches and sequential steps. This is misleading and contradicts the...
  - *Cited evidence:* Vision call failed: Error calling model 'gemini-1.5-flash' (NOT_FOUND): 404 NOT_, found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Theoretical Depth (Documentation)** (score 2/5)
   - Aim for: Terms appear in detailed architectural explanations. The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas. Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connec... Avoid: Terms appear only in the executive summary or introduction. No connection to actual implementation. 'We used Dialectical Synthesis' with no explanation of ho...

2. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 1/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
