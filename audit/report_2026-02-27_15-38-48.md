## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 4/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 4, Defense 5, TechLead 5.

- **Defense** (score 5): The team demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Theoretical Depth concepts, as evident in the detailed explanations of Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In/Fan-Out, and Metacognition. The report provides concrete examples of how these concepts are implemented, showcasing a hig...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A, content: term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True. StateGraph  Flow:  Detectiv
- **Prosecutor** (score 4): The report provides a good explanation of Fan-In/Fan-Out and State Synchronization, but lacks a clear connection between Metacognition and the system's evaluation quality. Dialectical Synthesis is explained with three parallel judge personas, but the explanation is brief.
  - *Cited evidence:* StateGraph Flow: Detective Fan-Out and Fan-In Conditional edges is required for , term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True
- **TechLead** (score 5): The report demonstrates a thorough understanding of Theoretical Depth concepts, providing detailed explanations of how Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In/Fan-Out, Metacognition, and State Synchronization are implemented in the architecture. The use of parallel judge personas for Di...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A, content: term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True. StateGraph  Flow:  Detectiv

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 1/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 1, Defense 2, TechLead 2.
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradict...

- **Defense** (score 2): The diagrams were not analyzed due to API quota exceeded, but the presence of 4 images suggests that the report might contain relevant information. However, without further analysis, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the diagrams.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9AXEDrdz/view
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): The diagrams do not accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. The flow does not match the actual code architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* No vision analysis was performed due to API quota exceeded, No clear indication of parallelism in the diagrams, Linear flow contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the report
- **TechLead** (score 2): The diagrams do not accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. The flow does not match the actual code architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* No indication of parallelism in the diagrams, Linear flow contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the report, Vision analysis skipped due to API quota exceeded

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 1/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
