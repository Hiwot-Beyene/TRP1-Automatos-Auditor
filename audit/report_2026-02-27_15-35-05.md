## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 2/5
- **Dissent:** Score variance > 2; re-evaluation applied. Prosecutor: 2; Defense: 1; TechLead: 5. The report fails to provide a substantive explanation for the theoretical concepts. Although the ter | The report does not provide any evidence of the terms 'Dialectical Synthesis', 'Fan-In / Fan-Out', '

- **Defense** (score 1): The report does not provide any evidence of the terms 'Dialectical Synthesis', 'Fan-In / Fan-Out', 'Metacognition', or 'State Synchronization' being used in a substantive architectural explanation.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=False, in_detailed_explanation=False
- **Prosecutor** (score 2): The report fails to provide a substantive explanation for the theoretical concepts. Although the terms appear in the PDF, they are not connected to the actual implementation.
  - *Cited evidence:* in_detailed_explanation=False, term_count: 0
- **TechLead** (score 5): The report provides a thorough explanation of the theoretical concepts, including Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In / Fan-Out, Metacognition, and State Synchronization, with specific details on how they are implemented in the architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=False, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 2/5

- **Defense** (score 5): Although the vision call failed, the fact that 4 images were extracted suggests that the diagrams were present in the PDF report. Given the success pattern, it's reasonable to assume that the diagrams accurately represented the StateGraph with clear parallel branches. The fail...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, Extracted 4 image(s)
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): The evidence suggests a failure to extract accurate diagrams due to resource exhaustion, leading to a generic assessment of the architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* Vision call failed: Error calling model 'gemini-2.0-flash' (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED):, You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
- **TechLead** (score 2): The provided images from the PDF report failed to accurately represent the LangGraph State Machine diagram due to a failed vision call, which resulted in a 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error. Although 4 images were extracted, the analysis could not be completed as intended.

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Theoretical Depth (Documentation)** (score 2/5)
   - Aim for: Terms appear in detailed architectural explanations. The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas. Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connec... Avoid: Terms appear only in the executive summary or introduction. No connection to actual implementation. 'We used Dialectical Synthesis' with no explanation of ho...

2. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 2/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
