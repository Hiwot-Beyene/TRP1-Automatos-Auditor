## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 4/5

- **Defense** (score 4): The report demonstrates a good understanding of theoretical concepts such as Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In/Fan-Out, and Metacognition. The use of these terms in a substantive architectural explanation suggests a high level of theoretical depth. However, the report could benefi...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A, content: term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True. StateGraph  Flow:  Detectiv
- **Prosecutor** (score 4): The report demonstrates a good understanding of theoretical concepts, but could provide more details on implementation.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A, content: term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True. StateGraph  Flow:  Detectiv
- **TechLead** (score 4): The report demonstrates a good understanding of theoretical concepts such as Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In / Fan-Out, and Metacognition. These terms are not just mentioned in the executive summary but are also explained in detail, with connections to the actual implementation....

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 2/5
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradict...

- **Defense** (score 2): The diagrams provided do not accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. The lack of visual distinction between parallel branches and sequential steps makes it difficult to understand the architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* No diagram shows a clear parallel split between Detectives and Judges, Diagrams show a generic box-and-arrow flow with no indication of parallelism
- **Prosecutor** (score 2): The diagrams lack explicit visualization of parallel branches and sequential steps, and the linear pipeline contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the report.
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BwftZs1DxbehAYPx6D5cUtYd9A, content: Extracted 4 image(s). Vision analysis skipped (API quota exceeded).
- **TechLead** (score 2): The diagrams do not accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. The flow does not match the actual code architecture.
  - *Cited evidence:* No indication of parallelism in the diagrams, Linear flow contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the report, Vision analysis skipped due to API quota exceeded

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 2/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
