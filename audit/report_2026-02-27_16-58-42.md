## Criterion Breakdown

One section per rubric dimension: final score (verdict), dissent summary where applicable, and the three judge opinions with cited evidence.

### Theoretical Depth (Documentation) (`theoretical_depth`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 4/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 4, Defense 4, TechLead 5.

- **Defense** (score 4): The team demonstrates a good understanding of Dialectical Synthesis and its implementation through three parallel judge personas. Additionally, they explain how Fan-In/Fan-Out is tied to specific graph edges for error handling. While the report could provide more details on th...
  - *Cited evidence:* StateGraph Flow: Detective Fan-Out and Fan-In is required for error handling., found=True, location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hiwot-Beyene/TRP1-Automat
- **Prosecutor** (score 4): The report demonstrates a good understanding of theoretical concepts, but it could be more explicit in explaining the implementation details. For instance, the report mentions Fan-In/Fan-Out in the context of StateGraph Flow, but it would be more convincing if it provided more...
  - *Cited evidence:* found=True, location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hiwot-Beyene/TRP1-Automat, content: term_count=2, in_detailed_explanation=True. StateGraph Flow: Detective 
- **TechLead** (score 5): The report demonstrates a thorough understanding of theoretical concepts and their practical application in the architecture. The explanations provided are detailed and connected to the actual implementation.
  - *Cited evidence:* StateGraph Flow: Detective Fan-Out and Fan-In is required for error handling., The report explains how Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel 

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)

- **Verdict (Final Score):** 2/5
- **Dissent:** Prosecutor 2, Defense 4, TechLead 2.
- **Remediation:** Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradict...

- **Defense** (score 4): I reward this effort for attempting to visualize the complex architecture. Although the diagrams are not always clear and some are misleading, I appreciate the team's attempt to represent the StateGraph and parallel branches.
  - *Cited evidence:* diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with some indication of parallel br, fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct in some diagrams, flow matches the actual code architecture in some parts
- **Prosecutor** (score 2): The diagrams lack thorough analysis due to API quota exceeded, making it impossible to determine their accuracy.
  - *Cited evidence:* Vision analysis skipped (API quota exceeded), content: Extracted 4 image(s). Vision analysis skipped (API quota exceeded).
- **TechLead** (score 2): The diagrams lack explicit visualization of parallel branches and sequential steps. Only two diagrams show any indication of parallelism, but they are incomplete and unclear.
  - *Cited evidence:* Diagram 1: Generic flowchart with no indication of parallelism, Diagram 2: Linear pipeline that contradicts parallel architecture, Diagram 3: Missing diagram in report, Diagram 4: Incomplete parallel visualization

## Remediation Plan

Specific, file-level instructions for the trainee. Criteria scoring below the target threshold (4/5) are listed with actionable steps.

1. **Architectural Diagram Analysis** (score 2/5)
   - Aim for: Diagram accurately represents the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. Fan-out and fan-in points are visually distinct. Flow matches the actual code architecture. Avoid: Generic box-and-arrow diagram with no indication of parallelism. Or no diagram present at all. Diagram shows linear flow that contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the r......
