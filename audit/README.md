# Audit Reports Directory

This directory contains generated audit reports organized by report type.

## Folder Structure

### `report_onself_generated/`
**Purpose:** Self-audit reports generated by this agent auditing its own repository.

**When used:** When running the audit with `--mode self` or `report_type="self"`.

**Example:** Auditing your own repository to evaluate your implementation against the rubric.

### `report_onpeer_generated/`
**Purpose:** Peer-audit reports generated by this agent auditing a peer's repository.

**When used:** When running the audit with `--mode peer` or `report_type="peer"`.

**Example:** Auditing another team's repository as part of peer evaluation.

### `report_bypeer_received/`
**Purpose:** Audit reports received from peers who audited this repository.

**When used:** When placing a peer's audit report of your repository here, or when `report_type="peer_received"`.

**Example:** A peer team audits your repository and you place their generated report in this folder. A sample peer-received report is checked in as `peer_received_report_2026-02-28.md` so that all three report types (self-generated, peer-generated, peer-received) are represented for rubric compliance.

### Root `audit/` directory
**Purpose:** Contains the most recent audit report (overwrites on each run).

**Files:**
- `audit_report.md` - The latest generated report (overwritten each run)
- `report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md` - Timestamped reports in subdirectories

## Report Structure

Each audit report includes:

1. **Report Type Label** - Clearly indicates whether it's a self-audit, peer-audit, or received peer-audit
2. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview of the audit results
3. **Criterion Breakdown** - All rubric dimensions with:
   - Final score (verdict)
   - Dissent summary (when applicable)
   - Explicit per-judge opinions (Prosecutor, Defense, Tech Lead)
   - Cited evidence for each opinion
4. **Remediation Plan** - File-level, granular remediation steps for criteria scoring below 4/5

## Usage

```bash
# Self-audit
uv run python scripts/run_audit.py <repo_url> [pdf_path] --mode self

# Peer-audit
uv run python scripts/run_audit.py <repo_url> [pdf_path] --mode peer
```

Reports are automatically saved to the appropriate subdirectory based on the `--mode` flag.
